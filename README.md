# Smart-Contract
Smart Contract DApp with React

This repository contains a decentralized application (DApp) built with React that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The project demonstrates how to integrate a frontend React application with a smart contract using Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Features
Smart Contract Deployment: Solidity smart contract for basic functionalities.
React Integration: Connect and interact with the smart contract using a React frontend.
Web3/Ethers Integration: Utilize Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
Metamask Authentication: Allow users to connect and authenticate with their Metamask wallet.
State Management: Efficient state management using React hooks and context.
User Interface: Clean and responsive UI for interacting with the smart contract.
Transaction Handling: Display and handle blockchain transactions and events.

## Technologies Used
Solidity: For writing the smart contract.
React: For building the user interface.
Web3.js/Ethers.js: For blockchain interaction.
Metamask: For user authentication.
Bootstrap/Material-UI: For styling the application.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development
Ganache for local Ethereum blockchain (optional)
Metamask browser extension

## Installation
### 1.Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-react-dapp.git
cd smart-contract-react-dapp`

### 2.Install NPM packages
`npm install`

### 3.Compile and Deploy Smart Contract
Using Truffle:
`truffle compile
truffle migrate`

Using Hardhat:
`npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`

### 4.Start the React App
`npm start`


## Usage
1.Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
2.Connect your Metamask wallet.
3.Interact with the deployed smart contract using the provided UI.
