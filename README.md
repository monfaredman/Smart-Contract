# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Smart-Contract

### Smart Contract DApp with React

This repository contains a decentralized application (DApp) built with React that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The project demonstrates how to integrate a frontend React application with a smart contract using Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Features

- Smart Contract Deployment: Solidity smart contract for basic functionalities.
- React Integration: Connect and interact with the smart contract using a React frontend.
- Web3/Ethers Integration: Utilize Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
- Metamask Authentication: Allow users to connect and authenticate with their Metamask wallet.
- State Management: Efficient state management using React hooks and context.
- User Interface: Clean and responsive UI for interacting with the smart contract.
- Transaction Handling: Display and handle blockchain transactions and events.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: For writing the smart contract.
- React: For building the user interface.
- Web3.js/Ethers.js: For blockchain interaction.
- Metamask: For user authentication.
- Bootstrap/Material-UI: For styling the application.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development
- Ganache for local Ethereum blockchain (optional)
- Metamask browser extension

## Installation

### 1.Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-react-dapp.git
cd smart-contract-react-dapp`

### 2.Install NPM packages

`npm install`

### 3.Compile and Deploy Smart Contract

Using Truffle:
`truffle compile
truffle migrate`

Using Hardhat:
`npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`

### 4.Start the React App

`npm start`

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
2. Connect your Metamask wallet.
3. Interact with the deployed smart contract using the provided UI.

## Project Structure

- contracts/: Solidity smart contract files.
- src/: React application source files.
  - components/: React components.
  - contexts/: React context for state management.
  - utils/: Utility functions and helpers (e.g., Web3/Ethers setup).
  - App.js: Main React component.
  - index.js: Entry point for the React app.
